An empire is a political construct in which a group or a people (often referred to as the imperial center or metropole) rule over territories outside of their original or initial borders through conquest, colonization, or other means of territorial expansion.
The history of the British Empire began in the 16th century, with the establishment of overseas colonies and trade posts, but it was during the 18th and 19th centuries that the empire reached its greatest territorial extent.
Britain wanted an empire to gain access to new markets and resources, to exert political and economic influence, and to establish itself as a dominant global power.
Colonialism is the policy or practice of acquiring and controlling territories outside of one's own country, often through the use of military force and/or economic and political means.
The "First British Empire" refers to the overseas colonies and trade posts established by Britain in the 16th and 17th centuries, primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India. These colonies were primarily established for economic reasons and were often run by trading companies.
The "Second British Empire" refers to the period of British territorial expansion and colonization that occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, when Britain established colonies and protectorates in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and became one of the most powerful imperial powers in the world.
The years between 1775-1783 was the period of the American Revolutionary War, in which 13 British colonies in North America rebelled against British rule and established themselves as the United States of America. This was a significant loss for the British Empire and a turning point in its history.
The "Scramble for Africa" was the period of intense territorial competition and colonization in Africa that occurred in the late 19th century, as European powers, including Britain, sought to establish colonies and control resources in Africa.
Settler colonies are territories in which large numbers of people from the colonizing country move and settle, creating a new society, culture and identity. Examples include Australia, Canada, and the United States. Non-settler colonies are territories in which the colonizing country maintains control and exploitation of resources and labour, but usually doesn't establish a large-scale settlement of its own citizens, examples include British India, British West Africa.
The Commonwealth is an intergovernmental organization made up of 54 member states, most of which were formerly part of the British Empire. The organization promotes cooperation and understanding among its members and aims to promote democracy, human rights, and economic development.
